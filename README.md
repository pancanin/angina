# Image Maze (Imaze?) Solver 

What it does?
You provide the program an image of a maze and it should find the entrance and exit and find a path.

Problems:

- How to convert an image to a 2D matrix which we can use for the maze?
- How to find a path from start to end in a 2D matrix?
- Can we extend this solver to 3D?
- How can we store all paths?
- How can we find the best path?
